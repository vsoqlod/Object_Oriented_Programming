# CECS277: Object Oriented Programming
This is where I keep all my projects for my object-oriented programming course. I've implemented a bunch of cool stuff using different design patterns and techniques. I use Python for everything, and I've split up my code into different classes to make things easier to manage.

## Project Structure:

- The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each representing a different project.
- Each project is implemented in the Python programming language.
- Each project has multiple files representing different classes used in the implementation.

> To try out one of my projects, just go to the corresponding directory and compile the Python files with a compiler like VScode. Then run the executable file to see what it does.
